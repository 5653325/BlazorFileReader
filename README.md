# BlazorFileReader
Demo of file streams in [Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor).

Attention, to use the code in this demo you need to use at least version 0.4.0-preview1-10303 of blazor, as it depends on the method Blazor.platform.toUint8Array which is not in 0.3.0 (latest nuget release of Blazor as of this writing).
